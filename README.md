# ðŸŽ² Tic Tac Toe ðŸŽ²

Welcome to our simple yet fun implementation of the classic game **Tic Tac Toe**! Also known as Noughts and Crosses, this version of the game is built with Python using the Tkinter library for its graphical user interface (GUI).


## ðŸŽ® How to Play

The rules are simple and quite straightforward:

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their symbol (either 'X' or 'O') on an empty cell in the grid.
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game!
4. If all the cells are filled and no player has won, then the game is a draw.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Before running the game, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You also need to have the Tkinter library, which comes pre-installed with standard Python distributions. 

To get started, run the Python script in your terminal:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
